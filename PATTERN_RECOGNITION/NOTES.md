## Bayesian Decision Theory:

Bayesian Decision Theory is a statistical framework that makes decisions based on probability theory. It involves the use of Bayes' theorem to update probabilities as new data becomes available, making decisions by maximizing expected utility.
Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):

MLE is a method for estimating the parameters of a statistical model. It seeks to find the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, which measures how well the model explains the observed data.
## Nonparametric Estimation:

Nonparametric methods don't make strong assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. Two examples you mentioned are:
Parzen Window: A method for estimating probability density functions by placing a window (kernel) at each data point and summing them up to get an estimate of the overall distribution.
k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): An algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA):

PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the axes in the data along which the variance is maximized. It transforms the original features into a new set of uncorrelated variables called principal components.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):

LDA is a dimensionality reduction and classification technique. It seeks to find the linear combinations of features that best separate two or more classes, making it useful for feature extraction and classification tasks.

## ABout

This repo will act as a boiler plate for seriously dweling into ML and AI . Here you will get all the statistical and mathematical foundation for the same .

You will also understand how each of these algorithms are implemented in

- CPP
- FORTRAN
- Python
- R
- GO

Cherry on the cake 


- CUDA based optimization for the above algorithms
- FPGA based speed up

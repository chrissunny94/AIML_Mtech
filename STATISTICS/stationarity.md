# About 

Stationarity can be defined in precise mathematical terms, but for our purpose we mean a flat looking series, without trend, constant variance over time, a constant autocorrelation structure over time and no periodic fluctuations (seasonality).


### There are 3 aspects of stationarity , 

- **Constant mean** ,

- **constant variance** ,

- **constant autocorrelation structure** ,


### Useful in 

- ARIMA (**Autoregression integrated moving average**)

- STL (**Seasonal decomposition of Time Series**)



### How to check for stationarity 

- Augmented Dickey-Fuller **(ADF)** test 
- Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin **(KPSS)** test.
